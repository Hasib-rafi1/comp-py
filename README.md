# The great guessing game in Python
CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY | DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING | Project | COMP 6411, Summer2019 | The great guessing game in Python


In this assignment, you will have a chance to gain experience with the Python programming language. Python is an easy to use, dynamically type Object Oriented language. It is syntactically similar to C-style languages like C++, C# and Java, but is somewhat simpler to
understand. You will be working with basic objects and various Python data structures in order to develop a simple command-line game that allows people to guess English words. The idea is as follows:


The user will be asked to guess 4-letter words. To make this realistic, we must utilize a large list of possible words. For this purpose, I have provided a text file containing 4030 4-letter English words. Your Python application will read the file from disk and load all strings into a data structure of your choice. To simplify things, you should place the file with the 4-letter words in the same folder as
your Python files.


Your program will randomly select a string and ask the user to guess the string. Initially, the string will be listed as “----“. The user will have the choice to try to guess the string directly or to guess a letter at a time.

Description pdf is uploaded with it. 

### Run Code

Install letest python 3.7.2

run the guess.py file 

After installing python. go to the directory where the files were kept. and run the command
`python guess.py`
